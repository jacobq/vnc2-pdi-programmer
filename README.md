# vnc2-pdi-programmer

:warning: work in progress

## Introduction

This program demonstrates a way to load compiled [AVR][avr-home] code onto  from a file (`avr-app.bin`) on a USB stick
attached to an [FTDI VNC2][vnc-home] with some of its I/O pins connected to the AVR MCU's [PDI][sigrok-pdi] lines.
I am making this project to help a colleague.
